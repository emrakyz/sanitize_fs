# Description
Sanitize file & directory names recursively according to UNIX and URL standards. This means:
- Nothing but lowercased alphanumeric English.
- Spaces, dots and dashes **-->** underscores.
- No consecutive, trailing, leading underscores.
- Keep the extensions intact.
  
The program is extremely fast; mostly instant with normal sized filesystems. If you try unrealistic number of files, directories (1 million+) with unrealistic levels of depth; then it can take about 10 seconds. 

# Advantages
- Utilizes all threads.
- Utilizes a [Thread Lock Mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)) for synchronization in order to prevent [Race Conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) and [Parent-Child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) problems.
- Written in pure [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#C2Y) with no external dependencies, using [Low Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) Linux kernel features.
- Can be statically compiled with agressive [Compiler Optimizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimizing_compiler) such as `-Ofast` and `LTO` (Link Time Optimizations).
- Skips the files that the current user doesn't own for robustness and speed.
- [Priveledged Root Usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) not allowed for security, safety.
- It skips [Dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory) (directories and files starting with a dot) encountered at any depth in order to protect configuration files, libraries and hidden files.
- It can never remove files because it uses [renameat2](https://lwn.net/Articles/592952/) function from **The Linux Kernel** with `NO_REPLACE` feature; therefore it is safe.
- It can be directly run on the terminal or it can be invoked by scripts and [TUI File Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_(file_manager)) keyboard shortcuts. Therefore, it runs fast and is used quickly.
- You can directly rename starting from `/` (the root directory) with a single command in order to rename simply everything on your system safely (excluding system files, dotfiles, [non-possessed files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions)), efficiently and in a very fast way.

# Disadvantages
- Obviously won't work on **Windows** and **Mac** but easily portable to **BSD**.
- Doesn't allow custom renaming rules due to safety and consistency. There are better tools that are geared towards custom renaming or simple shell scripts can be written for similar tasks.
- There is no GUI (Graphical User Interface). Though it would be counterproductive to use this program with a GUI.
- Instead of removing all non-English characters; similar characters could be converted to English characters (**Ã©** to **e**) but this is not feasible because:
  
  **a)** There are hundreds of languages and some of the character conversions can be subjective.
  
  **b)** It can be hard to implement because there would be lots of different matching conditions for all of the languages.
  
  **c)** It would make the code significantly bigger and harder to read but I guess it is possible to implement the feature with ANSI lookup tables. 

# Example
`___---...EXðŸ˜€AM- PðŸ˜€LE  . DIRðŸ˜€EC&TðŸ˜€O^RY..__--/___---...EXðŸ˜€AMPLE- ðŸ˜€ . VIDðŸ˜€EO&..__--.mkv`

Becomes:
`example_directory/example_video.mkv`

# Dependencies
Nothing but **The Linux Kernel Version >=3.15** and **Glibc Version >=2.28**. Easily portable to **BSD** and **Musl**.

# Installation
You can directly install a pre-compiled binary from the **Releases** page but the below method is safer and the program will work faster.
1. **Clone the repo:**
   
`git clone "https://github.com/emrakyz/sanitize_fs.git"`

2. **Get into cloned directory:**

`cd "sanitize_fs"`

3. **Statically compile as a single executable binary.**

**With Clang:**
```
clang -static -fno-pic -fno-pie -Ofast -flto=full -pipe -march=native -mtune=native -funroll-loops \
        -Wl,-O3 -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--icf=all \
        "sanitizefs.c" -o "sanitizefs"
```
**With GCC:**
```
gcc -static -fno-pic -fno-pie -Ofast -flto -pipe -march=native -mtune=native -funroll-loops \
        -Wl,-O3 -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,--gc-sections \
        "sanitizefs.c" -o "sanitizefs"
```

4. **Move the file to the desired location (Optional)**

`mv -fv "sanitizefs" "~/.local/bin"` **OR** `sudo mv -fv "sanitizefs" "/usr/bin"`

5. **Remove the cloned unnecessary directory.**

`rm -rfv "../sanitize_fs"`

# Usage
```
USAGE:
        sanitizefs [-dh] [path1] [path2] ...

EXAMPLES:
        sanitizefs EXAMPLE_DIR
        sanitizefs --dry-run "/home/username/EXAMPLE DIR"
        sanitizefs "/home"
        sanitizefs "VIDEO FILE.mkv" "PICTURE.jpg" "DIRECTORY" 

OPTIONS:
        -d, --dry-run        Perform a 'dry run' and exit for testing. Do not rename anything.
        -h, --help           Show this message and exit.
```

# Why Sanitize Filenames
- UNIX-like systems (**Linux** distributions, **BSD** derivatives, **Mac**) heavily favor the described naming conventions. Sanitizing ensures that files and directories interact seamlessly with everything.
- URLs must adhere to specific encoding standards. Sanitizing simplifies their use within web addresses, preventing potential encoding issues and broken links.
- Underscores act as very good word separators, improving file and directory name readability compared to spaces. Spaces used to split command line arguments; they are easier to miss and they require special encoding in URLs and they require escaping on the terminal. On the other hand, dashes are used for CLI programs' flags. Underscores are more unique in this aspect.
- Lowercase standardization eliminates confusion and potential errors when referencing files and directories in scripts or commands.
- It creates all around consistency on your system. You will structure, order, analyze your files in a better way.
- Eliminating special characters prevents issues with file paths in scripts, commands, and programs that might misinterpret them.
- Sanitization helps prevent malicious code injection techniques (like cross-site scripting) that can exploit unexpected characters in URLs.
- Locating, searching, sorting and all other I/O bound operations would be faster and easier. The `find` command, `fzf` command and TUI file managers will definitely be faster with lower latency and you will work with them in an easier, more robust way.
- No matter what website, what operating system or what device you use; these file and directory names will not be problematic and will be easily accessible.
- If you send any files to anyone through network or any other physical method; you will less likely to have problems.

# High Level Overview on How It Does Actually Work
1. Interpret the strings provided as a command line argument and convert them to full paths. 
2. Traverse all directories and files (excluding symbolic links, dotfiles directories and all of their contents and non-possessed files) with a [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) (depth-first search) algorithm. DFS method is used to prevent [Race Conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) and [Parent-Child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) problems (an upper level directory name being renamed before contents, therefore the contents get lost).
3. Create an [Array Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)) from the findings by allocating enough memory based on the number of entries that will be renamed. A [Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) could be used instead of arrays but mainly the data being processed is not that big here. The overhead from the implementation wouldn't outweigh the benefits of the simplicity of arrays.
4. Create threads based on the number of CPUs found on the machine.
5. Split the entries evenly among all of the threads. [Load Balancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)), [Work Stealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing) or similar algorithms could also be used but since the renaming operation is mostly instant, they wouldn't provide many benefits here.
6. Process entries depth by depth. The program keeps the record of the level of directory depth so it could only process one depth at a time in order to prevent [Race Conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition), conflictions and [Parent-Child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) problems. A more complex method could be implemented to process even more entries concurrently; but the complexity would probably introduce more problems than benefits.
7. [A Mutex Lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)) is used to track all entries. The lock won't be unlocked before every thread finishes processing all of the entries.
8. All of the threads start renaming the entries at the same time by using the character replacement logic (**replace_chars** function).
9. At the end, the lock is unlocked, and the parent directory is closed, and it is renamed individually. The same logic is also used for the indivudual files given to the program as command line arguments. Using threads for them are completely unnecessary since the process would be instant anyways.
10. If the user runs the program with `-d` or `--dry-run` flag, everything would be mostly the same but they will be able to see the before-after results without actually renaming anything.

# TUI File Manager Integration
You can directly use the program inside a directory on TUI File Managers such as [LF](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf), [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger), [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) or others. You can add a custom function with a keypress and automatically rename everything inside the current directory.

As an example, for LF file manager, you can create a custom function by assigning a keypress on its configuration file.

The below configuration creates a new command named sanitize and assigns it to "r" keypress: 
```
cmd sanitize ${{
	sanitizefs "$(dirname "${f}")"
}}

map r sanitize
```

You can see the instant renaming operation in the below example video.

# Video Showcase

The first example is unrealistic (a million entries). On an idle machine with 16 threads, the program processes a million entries on 10 level depth, in about 10 seconds.

The second example starting at **00:46**, shows a realistic example using a TUI file manager with an instant operation, with a keypress.
